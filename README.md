# JavaScript-Working-with-Conditional-Statements
I did an exercise showing the letter grade obtained from the course as a result of the score entered in the promt. I used the JavaScript Conditional Statements and BootStrap toolkit while performing this work.
You can see the visual of the work I have done through the screenshots I have left below. Thank you for your interest.
